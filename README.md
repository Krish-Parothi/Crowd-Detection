# Crowd-Detection
This project uses Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy to detect and count people in videos. It checks if the number of people crosses a set threshold and logs such crowd events into a CSV file. The output also includes annotated videos with bounding boxes for visualization.
